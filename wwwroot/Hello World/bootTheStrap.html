                    <p class="text-primary">Once there was a little red dog.  He lived in a tree bcause he was scared of the ground.  One day, as he was prancing among the leaves, an apple fell on his head.  It was a shiney white apple.  The apple had a power button.  The dog slowly moved his paw toward the power button.  The little white orb seemed to pulse and glow with light and inteligence.  The dog's paw crept ever nearer to the button.  Then, suddenly, the dog batted the apple away and on to the ground.  
                    "Good riddence."  The dog thought.  He scamperred away into the dark green leaves of his tree.  The leaves and braches rustled after him.  Then the sun set and the little red dog died.  It was a sad day for the Perkins family.  They never enjoyed finding dead dpgs in their petunias.  Mrs. Perkins convinced Mr. Perkins to place a sign in their yard with a warning about the petunias enscribed on it.  The sign stands in their front lawn.  It says:
                   "Beware Of The Petunias"</p>
                   <p>It also has decorative daisies painted in the corners.  Isabella thought they were a nice touch, showing class and refinement.  The squirrels in the neighbor's tree thought otherwise.  
                    At the stroke of midnight, the neighborhood squirrels convened in the Perkins Family chimney.  </p>
                   <p>"Something must be done" demanded an old gray squirrel "That sign completely disfigures the Perkins lawn.  It must be uprooted at once!"  
                   The elderly sqirrel's motion was carried without <mark>protest</mark>.  The fate of the sign was sealed.  The clock struck three, and the squirrels disbanded. The shape of an owl was seen, silloetted against the moon, as it flew in search of meaning in life.  
                    The sun rose huge and red several hours later.  When Mrs. Perkins gazed out her bedroom window, she could not believe her eyes.  The entire neighborhood had burned to the ground overnight.  
                    "Oh woe is me!"  She said, and fell into a dead faint.  Mr. Perkins sat bolt upright in bed.  "Hark!"  He said "The Harold-Angels next-door are singing!"  The door burst open and Isabella ran screaming into the room.  
                   "Oooohhh, it's horrrrible!"  She said, "All the horses ran away during the night!"</p>
                   <p>Terror filled Mr. Perkin's eyes as he heard this for it was grave news to heard first thing in the morning.  </p>
                   <p class="text-danger">"Whatever shall we do?"  Isabella asked.  </p>
                    <p>Mr. Perkins sighed and said in a low voice, "We can only hope, my dear, we can only hope."  
                    The sky grew dark, though it was only half past eight.  A dry wind began whistle a dreary tune.  Each note woke up dust motes and sent them out into darkening morning.  </p>
